This repository analyzes cumulative excess deaths for each US state, excluding
the first 8 weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic in order to focus on
long-term excess deaths.

Long-term excess deaths are defined as deaths after 2020-04-26, roughly the
second half of the first wave (Spring 2020), plus all deaths from subsequent
waves.

Long-term excess deaths are an indirect result of each state's long-term plan
and measures against the pandemic.

## Chart

For comparison, here is the same chart, same methodology, but counting all
excess deaths since the beginning of the pandemic:

## Methodology

We take [deaths reported by the US
CDC](https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/Excess-Deaths-Associated-with-COVID-19/xkkf-xrst/)
(column "Observed Number" where "Type" is "Predicted (weighted)"). The US
CDC weighted these figures to account for reporting delays. This
affects only data from the last few weeks. In our experience, weighted vs
unweighted has little impact on the chart above.

For each week **since 2020-04-26** we calculate the difference between reported
deaths and the average expected number of deaths from the US CDC (column
"Average Expected Count"). The difference can be positive or negative.

We add up these differences to calculate the final cumulative excess deaths
per capita.

Then we perform age-adjustment. Firstly we determine by how much the IFR of COVID-19
increases with each year of age. As per [Oâ€™Driscoll et al.: Age-specific mortality and immunity patterns of SARS-CoV-2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2918-0), in [Supplementary information](https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41586-020-2918-0/MediaObjects/41586_2020_2918_MOESM1_ESM.pdf) (table S3):

* IFR for ages 30-34 = 0.024%
* IFR for ages 75-79 = 3.203%

On this 45-year range, the IFR increases by: (3.203 / 0.024)^(1 / 45) =
1.115-fold with each year of increase. We term this factor **ifr_inc**.

Secondly, for each state, we determine the mean age of COVID deaths.
This is calculated from the [CDC dataset "Provisional COVID-19 Deaths by Sex and Age"](https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/Provisional-COVID-19-Deaths-by-Sex-and-Age/9bhg-hcku) by the script [calc_age_of_deaths.py](calc_age_of_deaths.py).

Thirdly, each state is adjusted by normalizing its excess deaths to what it
would be if the mean age of COVID deaths was 74 (an arbitrary value).
Concretely, excess deaths are simply mutiplied by:

ifr_inc ^ (74 - mean_age_of_covid_deaths)

Finally, to calculates excess mortality per capita, we use states population from the [US Census Bureau 2019 estimates](https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/datasets/2010-2019/state/detail/SCPRC-EST2019-18+POP-RES.csv).
